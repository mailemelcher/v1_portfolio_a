                    <h3>The Designer</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5rem;">Hello!  I'm Maile Melcher ,<br>
a multidisciplinary designer and Creative Media student with a passion for crafting meaningful<br>
visual stories through brand identity, packaging, and digital design. My work blends<br>
thoughtful strategy with creativity, resulting in designs that feel both intentional & alive.<br>

I hold a strong foundation in visual communication and user-centered design, strengthened<br>
by my education in Creative Media and Design and by real-world experience running my own<br>
small business, Prana Potions, where I developed every aspect of branding, packaging, and<br>
digital presence.<br>

Fluent in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Figma, I also love experimenting with<br>
tools like Procreate, Canva, CapCut, and p5.js to explore digital, motion, and interactive art.<br>
Whether I'm developing branding concepts, motion graphics, or user-focused layouts, I<br>
approach each project with curiosity, precision, and purpose.<br>


Inspired by nature, hiking, and Hawai'i's landscapes, I draw on organic balance and flow to guide<br>
my creative process — believing that great design should feel natural, cohesive, and intentional.<br>
Ultimately, my goal is simple: to create beautiful, meaningful designs that connect people<br>
to ideas — bridging creativity and clarity through visual design.<br></p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">Whether developing a brand identity,<br>
refining a digital interface,<br>
or shaping a visual story,<br>

my goal is always the same:<br>

to create meaningful designs that connect people to ideas beautifully<br>
and intentionally.<br></p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">HOBBIES</h3>
<p>When I'm not designing,<br> 
I love spending time outdoors:<br>
hiking, gardening, floristry and finding new ways nature can inspire my work.<br></p>
