                    <h3>The Designer</h3>
                    <p class="about-description">Hello! I&apos;m Maile Melcher, <br>a multidisciplinary designer and Creative Media student with a passion for crafting meaningful visual stories through brand identity, packaging, and digital design. My work blends thoughtful strategy with creativity, resulting in designs that feel both intentional &amp; alive.</p>

                    <p>I hold a strong foundation in visual communication and user&hyphen;centered design, strengthened by my education in Creative Media and Design and by real-world experience running my own small business, Prana Potions, where I developed every aspect of branding, packaging, and digital presence.</p>

                    <p>Fluent in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Figma, I also love experimenting with tools like Procreate, Canva, CapCut, and p5.js to explore digital, motion, and interactive art. Whether I'm developing branding concepts, motion graphics, or user-focused layouts, I approach each project with curiosity, precision, and purpose.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by nature, hiking, and Hawai&#699;i&apos;s landscapes, I draw on organic balance and flow to guide my creative process &ndash; believing that great design should feel natural, cohesive, and intentional. Ultimately, my goal is simple: to create beautiful, meaningful designs that connect people to ideas &ndash; bridging creativity and clarity through visual design.</p>

                    <p>my goal is always the same:</p>
                    <p>to create meaningful designs that connect people to ideas beautifully and intentionally.</p>
